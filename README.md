# AirportChallengeJS

I had done parts of the Airport Challenge in JavaScript as part of the Thermostat afternoon exercises; I finished off the Airport Challenge and added comments on each part of the program to solidify my learning and help make more sense of the program. I also challenged myself to make my airport controller a Sinatra web app. All of the back-end JavaScript and the HTML page works as intended, but the Jquery doesn't yet work as I want it to; I wanted a condition that changed the output based on the weather was stormy or not, which isn't currently working.

One of my goals was to write more comments in code that I write; I feel I satisfied this goal doing the Airport JS Challenge. Although my HTML and Jquery doesn't yet implement all parts of my JavaScript code, it's a good start.
